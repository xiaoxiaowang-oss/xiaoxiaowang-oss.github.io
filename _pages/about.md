I am a Ph.D. candidate in Management Information Systems at the 
**Fox School of Business, Temple University**. My research sits at 
the intersection of platform governance and the societal impact of 
technology, with a focus on two-sided content platforms. I draw on 
causal inference, survey methods, and deep learning to study how 
platforms shape — and are shaped by — the people who use them.

## Research

My current work examines questions like: How do content moderation 
policies affect the sustainability of online Q&A platforms? What are 
the broader externalities of autonomous vehicles beyond safety? And 
how do decentralized social media platforms navigate the 
efficiency-equity tradeoff?

Two of my papers are currently under review at **Management Science** 
and **MIS Quarterly**. My research has been presented at WISE, POMS, 
the Platform Strategy Research Symposium, and the INFORMS Annual 
Meeting.

## Background

Before joining Temple University, I earned an M.S. in Economics from 
**Purdue University** and a B.S. in Statistics from **Fudan 
University**. I also teach Python for Business and Data Science.
